Stripe was founded with the belief that accepting payments online was needlessly hard. Today, Stripe processes over $1T annually and more than 75% of the Forbes AI 50 use Stripe to monetise. Their approach emphasises developer-friendly tools, helping them outshine competitors like Square and Adyen in an intensely crowded market.

# Best Adaptable Agent

Prize: Exclusive Gift Bags
incident.io & Challenge Context

Incident.io is an incident management platform whose AI agent assists teams during live incidents, for instance triaging alerts and coordinating responses, and is trusted by elite engineering teams at Netflix, Airbnb, OpenAI and Etsy. Their driving belief is that in high-stakes, fast-moving situations, the ability to revise your understanding of the problem is more valuable than the ability to commit to a first guess.

Challenge: Build an AI agent that adapts intelligently and reconsiders its approach when new information demands it.
